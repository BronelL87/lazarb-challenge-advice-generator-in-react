### Peer Review


**Reviewer:** Micahel Heckerman
 

**Reviewer Notes:** Site looks pretty close to the design images. Worked properly on both desktop and mobile. All in all good job. The only thing I noticed was that you component and service folders were in the assets folder, little weird but the site still worked.
